Soulheart is a ready-to-use remote data source for autocomplete. The goal is to provide a solid, flexible tool that's downright easy to set up and use.

## Getting started

See the [Soulheart demo page](https://sethherr.github.io/soulheart/) for a step-by-step explanation of creating an instance and setting up a select box that uses it as a remote data source.


## Deployment

#### With Heroku [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

**You can instantly deploy Soulheart to Heroku for free!** This requires a verified Heroku account&mdash;you will have to add a payment method to Heroku but you won't be charged.

To update your Heroku deploy of Soulheart, use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command) and redeploy the app: 
  
    heroku deploy -a NAME_OF_YOUR_APP_ON_HEROKU
    

## In a Rails app

Soulheart is a gem. It uses [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis) on Ruby MRI. Add these lines to your gemfile:

    gem 'soulheart'
    gem 'hiredis', '~> 0.6.0' # Skip using JRuby
    gem 'redis', '>= 3.2.0', require: ['redis', 'redis/connection/hiredis'] # Skip if using JRuby


And add this in your routes.rb:

    require 'soulheart/server'

    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      # .... your application routes

      mount Soulheart::Server => '/soulhearts'
    end

You can then access the server when your rails app is running. You can run the [Soulheart commands](https://sethherr.github.io/soulheart/commands/) from that directory.

*Hote: On Heroku Soulheart uses `rackup` to start the server. Because of this, there's a `config.ru`, a `Gemfile.lock` and a `app.json`&mdash;to make it (and any forks of it) directly deployable. These files aren't in the Gem.*

##### Setting redis url

You can also set the redis url. 

```ruby
# config/initializers/soulheart.rb

Soulheart.redis = 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0'
# or you can asign an existing instance of Redis, Redis::Namespace, etc.
# Soulheart.redis = $redis
```
## Testing

Tested with rspec. Check out test information at [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/sethherr/soulheart).

You can run `bundle exec guard` to watch for changes and rerun the tests when files are saved.


## Requirements

Soulheart is a Redis backed Sinatra server. It's tested with the latest MRI (2.2, 2.1, 2.0) and JRuby versions (1.7). Other versions/VMs are untested but might work fine.

It requires Redis >= 3.0

## Additional info

This initially started as a fork of [Soulmate](https://github.com/seatgeek/soulmate) to support the features listed, provide demos and make it instantly deployable to Heroku.
